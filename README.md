# Bottom Panel

This is a gnome-shell extension that moves the top panel to the bottom. Not
having a top panel is very helpful when using applications like Chrome (for
accessing tabs with mouse). However, hiding the panel isn't a very elegant
solution to this as the panel holds very useful information such as the time,
battery status and with some extensions, weather, lock key status etc.

I see this extension as a solution to both the problems. I mostly made this to
scratch my own itch and since I use GNOME 3.10 that came with the Ubuntu GNOME
14.04, that's the only GNOME version I currently support.

There are no settings or fancy animations. I wish it were more featureful and
configurable, but lack of docs for extension development makes it very hard.

Any suggestions/feedback welcome. Just open an issue on github to discuss.
